## Why "sg-CM"?

"CM" is the country code for Cameroon, CAR's neighbor to the west. In order to
have a 2nd "Sango" entry show up in LibreOffice's Extra Languages list (which
is found in the font menu rather than the Tools > Languages menu) it seems to
require a unique country code. The official orthography spellchecker uses
"sg-CF", so the "simple" spellchecker was tried with just "sg", but it did not
produce a separate entry. After trying many other things it was discovered that
using "sg-CM" finally produced an additional Sango entry in that list.
