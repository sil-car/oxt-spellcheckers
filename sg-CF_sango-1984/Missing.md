## Missing words

| Sango | French | Document | Comment | Resolution |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| äpe | non (neg.) | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | DicoPlus entry for “non” is only “en-en”. KOYT spells the neg. as äpe. ||
| bâda | parlementaire (sanctuaire) | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | DP and KOYT spell this ‘bâda’ (though DP does not have a direct entry). Corrector suggests capital B, as in ‘Bâda’. ||
| fûu | fou | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | DicoPlus entry “interner” translates as the phrase ‘zîa na da tî fûu’. But the word ‘fûu’ does not appear in the spellchecker. ||
| gi | chercher | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Entry in DicoPlus was skipped somehow. ||
| ï | nous | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Entry in DicoPlus is the other one (ë). Maybe we should add this anyway. ||
| Jesus | Jésus | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Spellchecker marks ‘Jesus’ as incorrect; it proposes ‘Jésus’. (Jesus/Jésus does not appear in DicoPlus.) Since it appears at all, better to appear without an accent. ||
| kandâa | cependant (however) | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | No occurrence of this word in DicoPlus. Entry of ‘cependant’ in DicoPlus is kamême or kamëme. KOYT says ‘kandâa’ is ‘however/while’. ||
| kânga | fermer | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Entry in DicoPlus was skipped somehow. ||
| kua | travail | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Entry in DicoPlus was skipped somehow. ||
| mbëtï | papier | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | DP and KOYT have this spelling but the spellchecker proposes other tones. ||
| me | mais (but) | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | No entry in DicoPlus, but is spelled without an accent in KOYT. ||
| ndokua | entreprise | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Entry in DicoPlus was skipped somehow. AND suggested word “ndökua” does not seem to exist in DicoPlus. ||
| (fün) sen | répugner | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Entry in DicoPlus was skipped somehow. ||
| sïönî | vil | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Corrector proposes ‘sïönï’ and ‘sîönî’, neither of which occur in KOYT and not in the entry ‘vil/vile’ in DP. ||
| süä, sûâ | aiguille | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Both spellings of ‘needle’ appear in DicoPlus (although the entry for ‘aiguille’ is sûâ). KOYT and the tract both use süä. Add both to spellchecker? ||
| zo | personne | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | No entry in DicoPlus, but is spelled without an accent in KOYT. ||
