|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| äpe | non (neg.) | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | DicoPlus entry for “non” is only “en-en”, but example phrases use "pëpe". KOYT spells the neg. as äpe. ||
| bâda | parlementaire (sanctuaire) | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | DP and KOYT spell this ‘bâda’ (though DP does not have a direct entry). Corrector suggests capital B, as in ‘Bâda’. | fixed in v2024.10.28 |
| fûu | fou | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | DicoPlus entry “interner” translates as the phrase ‘zîa na da tî fûu’. But the word ‘fûu’ does not appear in the spellchecker. | fixed in v2024.10.28 |
| gi | chercher | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Entry in DicoPlus was skipped somehow. | not in scraped DicoPlus-wordlist.txt; investigation needed |
| ï | nous | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Entry in DicoPlus is the other one (ë). Maybe we should add this anyway. | fixed in v2024.10.28 |
| Jesus | Jésus | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Spellchecker marks ‘Jesus’ as incorrect; it proposes ‘Jésus’. ("Jésus" appears in DicoPlus in definition of "wandarä".) | No change needed. |
| kandâa | cependant (however) | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | No occurrence of this word in DicoPlus. Entry of ‘cependant’ in DicoPlus is kamême or kamëme. KOYT says ‘kandâa’ is ‘however/while’. ||

| sïönî | vil | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Corrector proposes ‘sïönï’ and ‘sîönî’, neither of which occur in KOYT and not in the entry ‘vil/vile’ in DP. | fixed in v2024.10.24 |
| süä, sûâ | aiguille | Tract: Ala gi Yanga ti Nzapa | Both spellings of ‘needle’ appear in DicoPlus (although the entry for ‘aiguille’ is sûâ). KOYT and the tract both use süä. Add both to spellchecker? | fixed in v2024.10.28 |
